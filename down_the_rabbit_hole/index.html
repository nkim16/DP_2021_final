    <p class="modal-txt"><span class="highlight">"Down the Rabbit Hole: Signed In"</span> is a project about the processes and the tools that are consumed while surfing the web: the loss of control and the loss of thoughts that are often involved in browsing. And how the simple action of just signing in can build a profile and an identity of a person by tech companies<i>(i'm talking to you Google)</i> for their own data. Our actions are constantly directed by tools-tools that are given to us by companies to go down a rabbit hole. By looking back at my search history, I realize how dependent I was and still am on these platforms, <i>especially during the height of COVID,</i> as a form of entertainment, research, and communication.  <br><br><br><!-- Search histories are essential to big name companies such as Google to profile peopleâ€”infringing our privacy rights. -->
 By looking back at my search history, I gain an inside look at myself while also being critical of how these corporations view me. I wanted to attempt to reveal this human and intimate process of navigating the web that often leads us to go down a rabbit hole, leaving invisible and digital, footprint that is left behind in our search history to be examined by Google. By going down a rabbit hole, I am navigating websites that were never intended to be saved and collecting something seemingly useless and mindless turned into somethig permanent.    <br><br>
